# Innoscripta Data Hackathon

his hackathon project aims to provide comprehensive data about companies from around the world. The main goal is to develop an application that allows users to 
retrieve information about a company by providing its name, country, and optionally the website. The application will then display details about the company's 
products/services along with relevant images.

## Features

- User-friendly Front End: We have developed a Streamlit-based interface for easy interaction with the application.
- Company Information Retrieval: By entering the company name and country, users can access extensive data about the company.
- Optional Website Input: Users can also provide the company website for more precise search results.
- Fast and Reliable Back End: The application's back end is built using the FastAPI framework, ensuring efficient retrieval and delivery of company information.

## Usage

1. Access the application's Front End through the provided URL.
2. Input the desired company's name and country in the designated fields.
3. Optionally, provide the company's website for more accurate results.
4. Click the search button to retrieve information about the company.
5. Explore the displayed data, including product/services details and relevant images.

## Technologies Used

- Streamlit: The user-friendly front end is built using the Streamlit framework.
- FastAPI: The robust back end is developed using the FastAPI framework, ensuring fast and efficient information retrieval.

  ## Future Enhancements

  We are constantly working to improve the application and plan to add the following features in the future:

- Enhanced search capabilities, including advanced filters and sorting options.
- Integration with external data sources to expand the range of available company information.
